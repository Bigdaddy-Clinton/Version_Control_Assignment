## ðŸ“„ Programming Paradigms Overview

In this assignment, I explore five core programming paradigms:

1. **Imperative** â€“ step-by-step commands and mutable state  
2. **Object-Oriented** â€“ encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism  
3. **Functional** â€“ pure functions, immutability, higher-order functions  
4. **Logic** â€“ facts & rules with Prolog-style inference  
5. **Event-Driven** â€“ event loops, callbacks, async I/O

### 1. Introduction
*Programming paradigms are â€¦*

### 2. Imperative Programming
**Philosophy**  
Imperative programming mirrors the machineâ€™s step-by-step model.  
**Core**  
- Variables & assignment  
- Control structures (loops, conditionals)  
- Subroutines  
**Pros/Cons**  
- Pros: High performance, low-level control  
- Cons: Mutable state bugs, hard to reason about global state  

*(â€¦and so on for OOP, FP, Logic, Event-Drivenâ€¦)*
